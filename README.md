## Overview

This project uses a regression model to predict math scores for students. The model is trained on features such as:

- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Parental Level of Education
- Lunch Type
- Test Preparation Course
- Reading and Writing Scores

The application integrates a machine learning pipeline for preprocessing, feature engineering, and prediction, ensuring seamless and accurate results. Predictions are displayed with a precision of **2 decimal places**.
